Competitive Collaborative Quantization (CCQ) framework for layer-wise mixed precision quantization

The framework is built upon Intel's NervanaSystems Distiller repository: https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller

The file "fly_on.py" contains the essential commands to invoke actual distiller compression schedule.

A newer version with updated flexibilities will be uploaded soon.
